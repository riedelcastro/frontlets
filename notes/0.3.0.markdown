This version includes a substantial refactoring that introduces an frontlet class that abstracts over the
type of underlying map used. In particular, the underlying map may be immutable. In this case the modification operations
on slots return modified *copies* of the original frontlet. By contrast, with mutable maps the return type of
modification operations is ``frontlet.type``, and the returned object is the frontlet itself.

Immutable frontlets in action:

    val person = new ImmutablePerson().age(18)
    val changed = person.age := 36
    person.age() must be (18)
    changed.age() must be (36)
