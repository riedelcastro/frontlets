[frontlets][fr] are lightweight typed wrappers around Scala maps, and can be used for type-safe and succinct access
to JSON-like data in Scala. In particular, frontlets come with support for MongoDB, and make working with mongo collections
more convenient and less error-prone, while retaining all their power and flexibility.
